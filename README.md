## Summary

This was a fun and challenging project. There are lots of parts at play and it was cool to see them all fall into place.

Features:

- Add, subtract, divide and multiply any two numbers together
- Continued operations (eg. 1+2+3+4=10)
- Memory support to save numbers for future use
- Clear button to start from scratch
- Supports negatives and decimals

_Does not yet support exponents or numbers over 10 billion._

What I learned:

- How to reorganize my code in a much cleaner way
- How to use CSS flexbox effectively
- How to use calculator memory buttons (I'd never used them before!)
